					"a": "I was trying to work on my maths homework, but then I got distracted because my phone notified me that my best friend Lola was in the area, shopping! Should I go out and meet her? Hmm...",
					"b": "Can you believe it? The new drone posts pictures of everything we do, and shows it to everybody in the neighbourhood. This makes it hard to secretly meet my friends to hang out and smoke without my parents knowing our whereabouts. Just check out that old woman over there. I bet ya she'll tell my parents that I haven't done my homework!",
					"c": "This makes me feel safe. I feel it is like my guardian angel drone. We don't need to ask each other 'are you home safe?' after a night out anymore, because the police know about our whereabouts at all times."

					"a": "This drone seems very convenient to get customers for my work. But I don't have time to check all of the images so I've lost control over which ones are uploaded: it even puts the failed paintings online!",
					"b": "Since this drone is here, I don't need to be in well-known public places to get viewers for my art work anymore. This is very useful, but I miss travelling to art shows so much and getting in touch with my customers and fellow artists. Besides, I feel watched. Have you seen those people over there? What if they steal my ideas for the next painting?",
					"c": "It is nice that thanks to the new drone I don't need to worry about protecting my paintings anymore. However, I am a bit worried as sometimes I make activist art. I hope the government won't monitor me for that!"
